    "Age-depth models are used in paleoclimate analyses in the field of reconstructing past climate environments. Vertical sediment profiles (cores) contain information about past environmental conditions at every depth. However, the relation between the depth in a sediment core and the corresponding age of the material is not given at any depth, because of the limited sampling rate (e.g. every 20 cm). To draw age conclusions also from depths inbetween sampling points a way of interpolating the samples is needed, hence the need for age-depth models. Additionally, and similar important (maybe even more) is a good estimation of the errors of the interpolated age-depth relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to other methods we apply restrictions to our model, e.g. that age must increase monotonically with depth (e.g. Blaauw and Christen 2005). Further we adopt the idea of an underlying physical accumulation process of the sediment according to a sedimenatation rate (Blaauw and Christen, 2011). The evolution or change of the sedimentation rate over time is responsible for the shape of the age-depth curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are some good age-depth model on the market, the question arises, why do we need another one. The answer is twofold. (i) our aim is to provide a simple age-depth model, where the user can really get into the source code and adjust it to his/her needs. We don't want a black-box, where the user cannot interact with, unless being a programming and statistics expert. This includes a clear, simple and transparent error estimation, which is crucial. (ii) we apply a new Bayesian step (borrowed from astro-physics), not used yet in this way in age-depth modelling, which finally gives a very attractive answer to the essential question of finding the best fitting curve for the data given the physical basis and restrictions."
